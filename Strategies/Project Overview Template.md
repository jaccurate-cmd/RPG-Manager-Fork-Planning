## Planning

- [ ] Schedule
	- [ ] Start date
	- [ ] Milestones
	- [ ] End date
	- [ ] Timeline
		- [ ] Make a network of each subtask showing dependencies. Each node has a start/end date. Nodes are connected to their dependencies. Some tasks or groups of tasks may therefore happen in parallel.
		- [ ] "Critical Path" - The single path through the timeline of dependencies that will take the longest. If tasks can be done in parallel, this path is the most important to stay on target because delays on it will necessarily slow down the project.
		- [ ] Add buffers for subtasks based on difficulty, complexity, or a reliance on people I can't control
- [ ] Budget
- [ ] Risk Management Plan
	- [ ] List every single reason your project is likely to fail, roughly in order of likelihood
		- Motivation
			- #TODO write a drop-in motivation action plan
		- Technical limitations
		- Deprioritization
			- #TODO write a plan along the lines of the following:
				- Decide whether to commit to the project or change priorities
				- If this project is being paused rather than killed, schedule when to hit play, or at least reevaluate
	- [ ] For every threat, write an action plan for what you can do starting right away to make sure those threats don't happen

## Execution

- Make it as fun as possible. Whatever parts of the project aren't enjoyable, can you find a way to not do them?
- Accountability/tracking for completion
	- When will you track updates to this project and reflect on where you are in this plan?
	- How will you celebrate milestones?
- Consistency is more important than intensity

## Closing

- [ ] Write up closing report
	- Address success criteria
	- Compare outputs to goals
	- Evaluate any changes to anticipated value
- [ ] Write up lessons learned
	- Specific technological lessons learned
	- Any unanticipated threats that affected the project
